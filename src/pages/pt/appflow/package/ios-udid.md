title: Get your UDID
---

## Summary

The UDID (Unique Device Identifier) of an iOS device identifies it to Apple. You'll need to know the UDID of your development device in order to create a provisioning profile for it.

The UI for getting the UDID is a bit weird, so bear with us!

* Plug the device into your computer and open iTunes.

* Click the Serial Number until you see UDID.

* Right click and copy the UDID to extract from iTunes.
